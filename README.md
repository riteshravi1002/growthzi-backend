Growthzi Backend Developer Assignment – AI Website Generator
This project is a backend solution for generating AI-powered website content based on a business type and industry, built with Flask, MongoDB, and OpenAI (via OpenRouter).

It includes secure JWT-based authentication, dynamic content previews, HTML export, and admin cleanup tools — all built using clean, modular Flask blueprints.

✅ Features
🔐 Authentication
/auth/signup: Register with email and password (stored securely with hashing)

/auth/login: Log in and receive JWT token

🤖 AI Website Generation
/generate/: POST route to generate website content using OpenRouter's GPT-3.5

Uses structured prompts to return JSON with hero, about, services, and contact

💾 Data Storage
MongoDB stores each generated website along with:

Authenticated user’s email

Creation timestamp

🖼 Preview + UI
/generate/preview/<id>: View the full website content using Tailwind-styled HTML

/generate/list: See a table of all sites generated by the logged-in user

🧼 Admin Actions
/generate/delete/<id>: Deletes any generated site by ID (JS-powered)

/generate/export/<id>.html: Download the website content as an HTML file

🔐 Protected Endpoints
All /generate/* routes are JWT-protected. Include the token in your headers:

pgsql
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>

📦 Tech Stack
Flask (Blueprint structure)

MongoDB (via Flask-PyMongo)

Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT auth

OpenRouter API (GPT-3.5 for content generation)

Tailwind CSS for beautiful previews

Jinja2 for HTML templating
